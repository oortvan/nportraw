### Nportraw can be started in 3 ways
*1 as a process in the current shell terminal
*2 as a process that creates the next empty runfile and aborts, use second argument -n
*3 as a deamon that runs in the background, use second argument -r

To function nportraw always needs a xml configuration file as its first argument, witout it nportraw aborts doing nothing.
