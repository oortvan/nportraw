# Time Synchronisation 
## Sonic anemometer Gill-R3 and Gas-Analuzer LICOR-7500Rs

When calculating fluxes from turbulence measurements it is very important to know the time lag between samples from different instruments.  This time lag is considered constant, in order to use a constant time lag samples from instrument A and B must be time synchronized.
